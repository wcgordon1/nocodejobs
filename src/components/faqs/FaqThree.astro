    question: "How do I build a strong no-code portfolio that gets interviews?",
    answer: "Create 3-4 high-quality projects that demonstrate real-world problem-solving. Include a SaaS application, an e-commerce site, and an automation project. Document your build process, showcase metrics like user growth or revenue, and create video demos. Host your portfolio on a custom Webflow or Bubble site to demonstrate your skills firsthand.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best way to prepare for no-code technical interviews?",
    answer: "Focus on three key areas: 1) Platform expertise - be ready to explain your technical decisions and workflow in your primary no-code tool, 2) Problem-solving - prepare to whiteboard solutions and discuss architecture choices, 3) Business impact - quantify the results and ROI of your previous projects. Practice explaining complex features in simple terms.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I work for an agency or go in-house as a no-code developer?",
    answer: "Agencies offer diverse project experience and faster skill development, typically paying $50-100/hour for experienced developers. In-house roles provide deeper product ownership and stability, with salaries ranging $80-150K. Consider starting at an agency to build your portfolio, then transition in-house once you have strong expertise in a specific platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I transition from traditional development to no-code?",
    answer: "Start by mastering one major platform (Bubble, Webflow, or FlutterFlow) and build a clone of a popular app. Leverage your existing development knowledge of databases, APIs, and architecture. Join no-code communities on Discord and Twitter. Create content showing how to solve traditional coding problems using no-code tools.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the most effective way to negotiate no-code developer rates?",
    answer: "Research market rates for your chosen platform ($50-150/hour depending on experience). Document concrete metrics from past projects like development time saved or revenue generated. Highlight specialized skills like API integrations or custom workflows. Consider value-based pricing for projects where you can directly impact business outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which no-code platform should I specialize in for the highest paying jobs?",
    answer: "Bubble consistently offers the highest rates ($80-150/hour) due to its power and complexity. Webflow specialists can earn $60-120/hour, especially with custom CMS builds. FlutterFlow is emerging with strong demand. Choose based on: 1) Market demand in job boards, 2) Your background (design vs technical), 3) Type of projects you enjoy building.",
