# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 7, 2024

Welcome to **nocodejobs.org** (the "Website"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard it.

## 1. **Information We Collect**

- **For Job Seekers:**
  - When you apply for a job through our Website, you may provide your name, email address, resume, and other relevant application details. We do **not** store your resume on our servers. Your resume and contact information are forwarded directly to the employer who posted the job.

- **For Employers:**
  - When you post a job on our Website, we collect information about your business, including company name, contact details, and payment information (processed securely through third-party payment processors).

- **Analytics Data:**
  - We use **Pirsch.io** for website analytics. Pirsch is a GDPR-, CCPA-, PECR-, and Schrems II-compliant analytics service that operates under strict European privacy laws. It does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) and anonymizes data by default.

## 2. **Cookies and Tracking**

- We use **Pirsch.io** for analytics, which does **not use cookies**.
- We do **not** use any other cookies or tracking mechanisms on our Website.

## 3. **How We Use Your Information**

- **Job Seekers:**
  - Your personal information and resume are shared only with the employers you choose to apply to. We do not retain, store, or process your resume data beyond forwarding it to the employer.

- **Employers:**
  - Your business information is used to facilitate job postings and communicate with potential candidates. We may use your contact details to notify you of new applicants or updates related to your job post.

- **Analytics:**
  - We use non-identifiable, anonymized data provided by Pirsch.io to understand website usage and improve the user experience. No personal data is collected or stored for analytics purposes.

## 4. **Data Retention**

- We do **not collect** any personal data outside of what is processed by Pirsch.io for analytics.
- We do **not store any personal data** or resumes on our servers.

## 5. **Data Deletion**

- Since we do **not store** any personal data or resumes, we do not have a data deletion policy for such information. All resumes and contact details are forwarded directly to employers and are not retained by us.

## 6. **International Users**

- This Website is intended for users **within the United States**. We do not offer services to users outside of the USA and do not process international data requests.

## 7. **Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

- Our Website is **not intended for users under the age of 18**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under 18 years old. If we become aware that we have collected data from someone under 18, we will take steps to delete that information.

## 8. **Data Sharing and Disclosure**

- We do **not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer** your personal information to third parties, except as required for service functionality (e.g., sharing your resume with the employer you applied to).
- We may disclose information when legally required, such as in response to a court order or government request.

## 9. **Data Security**

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 10. **Your Rights**

- **For Job Seekers and Employers:**
  - You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at [hello@nocodejobs.org](mailto:hello@nocodejobs.org).
- **Analytics Data:**
  - Since we use Pirsch.io, which is compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations, you have the right to opt out of analytics tracking. Pirsch.io does not use cookies or other tracking methods that require user consent under GDPR.

## 11. **Third-Party Links**

Our Website may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

## 12. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
