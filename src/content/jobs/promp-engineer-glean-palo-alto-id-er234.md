### About Glean

We’re on a mission to make knowledge work faster and more humane. We believe that AI will fundamentally transform how people work. In the future, everyone will work in tandem with expert AI assistants who find knowledge, create and synthesize information, and execute work. These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work.

We’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications.

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers who saw a need in the enterprise space for their technical depth and passion for AI. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.

We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others.

### Prompt Engineering at Glean

As Glean’s prompt engineering lead, you will sit at the intersection of our GTM and R&D teams. You will be working directly with customers to realize the full capabilities of Glean’s Work AI platform, through scaled enablement and by helping customers customize the platform for their specific needs. Additionally, you will be collaborating with our engineering team to push the boundaries of our platform, exploring new verticals (e.g., finance and legal), and growing the number of use cases in the Glean Prompt Library.

Given that the field of prompt engineering is very new, we understand that it’s unlikely that you will have direct experience on your resume. If you’d like to apply for this position, please include any projects you’ve worked on that demonstrate your ability to get complex behaviors from a major LLM via a series of well crafted prompts or any materials you’ve created that introduce prompting best practices to a general audience.

### What You Will Do And Achieve at Glean

- Spending a lot of time with our customers to deeply understand their knowledge needs
- Developing key parts of our product roadmap, marrying customers’ needs with our product vision
- Empowering your team by giving context, setting direction, and building alignment
- Driving customer-focused decisions, clear prioritization, and efficient execution
- Coordinating cross-functionally with leadership, go-to-market teams, and other key stakeholders across the company
- Building processes that will scale as our team and company go through rapid growth

### Who You Are

- You have 3+ years of experience in a technical role such as Product Manager, Software Engineer, or Solutions Engineer with a track record of interfacing with customers in high-capacity and significantly driving the adoption of your products' rich capabilities.
- You possess a strong technical background with some experience in coding or scripting languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) and have a solid understanding of AI and machine learning concepts, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs) and prompting capabilities.
- You have a proven ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that customers can effectively leverage advanced product features.
- You think strategically about how to scale up training and enablement for Glean’s GTM team and customer base by documenting and sharing best practices.
- You are passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI and LLM technologies, and you are eager to apply this knowledge to drive innovation and deliver value to customers.
- You are adept at gathering and analyzing customer feedback, using it to inform product improvements and drive the development of new features that enhance user experience and engagement.
- You are an excellent written and verbal communicator.
- You have a proven track record of taking ownership, taking initiative, and delivering results.
- You collaborate effectively with cross-functional partners.
- You have a learning and growth mindset.
- You are mission-first and understand that your success is measured by your product and team’s success.
