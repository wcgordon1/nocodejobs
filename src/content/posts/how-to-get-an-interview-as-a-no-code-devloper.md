In this guide, we will cover how to effectively email or message a company and what key elements to include to increase your chances of landing an interview. Much of this content is inspired by Erik Goins' insightful [Twitter thread](https://x.com/erikgoinsHQ/status/1619881714490445825).

## 1. Read the Job Post Thoroughly
In one message, you should include everything needed for the employer to decide if you're a fit for the job. Missing basic information shows a lack of attention to detail. As Erik Goins points out:

> "If you don't include basic information, does that sound like the right person for the job?"

Many job seekers fail to reference specific job details in their messages. Check out this post from Ian on the [No Code Jobs subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeJobs/comments/1djduto/comment/l9arvk1/). Including a Loom video as part of your application can make a big difference, as it shows extra effort.

## 2. What to Include in Your Message
Make sure to include the following:
- **CV, LinkedIn, Portfolio**: If you don't have a portfolio, use free options like Linktree or GitHub Pages.
- **A Thoughtful Note**: Explain why you're the right person for the job and what you know about the company.
- **Project Links**: Provide links to relevant projects that showcase your skills.

If you don’t have a LinkedIn, create one. Follow [No Code Jobs](https://nocodejobs.org). No resume? Use this [free template](https://docs.google.com).

## 3. Be Professional
This is straightforward:
- Send one message.
- Wait two days before following up politely.

First impressions matter, so make sure your communication is clear and professional.

## 4. Button Up Your Resume
Ensure your resume looks good:
- **Use Spell Check**: Run it through tools like ChatGPT or Grammarly.
- **Get Feedback**: Ask a friend, teacher, or someone at your local coffee shop for feedback.
- **Check for Errors**: Make sure everything is spelled correctly and that the technical terms are accurate.

Need a second opinion? Email your resume to [resumes@nocodejobs.org](mailto:resumes@nocodejobs.org) for feedback.

## 5. Show Interest and Ask Questions
Demonstrate genuine interest in the position:
- **Ask Questions**: Save your questions for when the conversation starts. This helps you understand if you're a good fit.
- **Do Your Research**: Show that you know what the company does and how your skills align.

Avoid specific HR questions until you’re further along in the interview process.

## 6. No Code Application Email Template
