## Why PopResume Wins
[PopResume](https://www.popresume.com) combines an ATS-optimized resume builder with a role-aware AI interview coach. Instead of juggling separate tools (a generic builder, a chatbot, and a question pack PDF), you create a tailored resume, practice high-yield answers, and walk away with a job-ready packet—fast.

## What Typical Tools Do
Traditional resume builders focus on formatting and a handful of templates. Chatbots can riff on bullet points but don't understand ATS signals, recruiter heuristics, or the difference between "busy words" and "hired words."

**Common gaps with other tools:**
- **No ATS targeting:** Pretty templates that quietly break parsing.
- **Fluffy bullets:** Wordy lines without metrics, impact, or verbs that scan.
- **Disconnected prep:** Interview practice lives in a different app with no link to what's on your resume.

## What PopResume Adds
PopResume is built around how recruiters actually screen:
- **ATS-First Templates:** Clean structure, correct section ordering, and safe typography.
- **[Resume Writing Services:](https://www.popresume.com/resume-writing)** The perks of a professional resume writer without the added cost. Craft beautiful resumes tailored to each specific job!
- **Keyword Targeting:** Paste a job link or description; PopResume surfaces skills/phrases to include naturally.
- **Impact Bullets:** AI refines each line for **verb + scope + metric + outcome**—not fluff.
- **Gap-Aware Editing:** Flags weak patterns (passive voice, vague ownership, filler KPIs).
- **AI Interview Coach:** Role-specific questions, timed practice, and structured feedback (STAR/CAR).
- **One Stack, One Truth:** Resume content informs interview drills so your story is consistent.
